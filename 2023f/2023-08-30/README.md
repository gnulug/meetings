# A plush introduction to cluster computing,
## Using [Engineering a Beowulf-style Compute Cluster](https://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Beowulf/beowulf_book/beowulf_book/beowulf_book.html) as a guide and reference

Although the text is nearly old enough as your average freshman, it retains its value by its simplicity, its breadth, and coherency (mostly).
* Simple -> Refers to himself as a "Sears" Computer Scientist
* Breadth -> Covers theory to (eventually) rewiring your house
* Coherency -> Between the extreme ends of his content, there aren't any appreciable gaps

Why do any of this? 
 * You have calculations to do and not enough time to do them
 * Jensen Huang has an insatiable appetite for your money.
