# Automatic Reproducibility for Science

## Motivation

I
- Trust in science comes from independent reproduction of results
- Science is an inherently communal effort

II
- During the COVID pandemic, epidemiological simulations done by Neil Ferguson (Imperial College) showed that lockdowns could significantly reduce the death toll.
- This simulation was not made easilly available for a number of reasons, one of which was the software would be onerous to run on any other system.
- This, among other issues, reduced public confidence in the simulations

III
- In theory, computational experiments should be much easier to reproduce than physical experiments (basically automatic)
- Modern tools solve "software environment portability" in theory, like portability libraries, Nix, VMs
- But even so, it is not easy for other scientists to reproduce simulations
- The tools still require expensive "interventions"
- No incentive to follow interventions, especially in the highly-competetive nature of modern academia
- Seek more "automatic" methods, require less and less intervention

## Vision

- Just run code normally, and we'll create a reproducible version
- Computational provenance := process and inputs used to generate a specific output
  - Disjoint graph between Processes and files
  - Recursive
  - ![Example of computational provenance](./prov_example.svg)
  - [`./count.sh`](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/reprozip-examples/blob/master/bash-count/count.sh)
  - ![Real example of computational provenance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VIDA-NYU/reprozip-examples/master/bash-count/graph.png)
- Capture system calls that manipulate file system or process-tree
  - Tradeoff between granularity and overhead
  - Don't necessarily need to capture read/write (very many of these!) just need to capture open-for-reading and open-for-writing
- Example applications
  - Send script to reproduce experiment
  - Script can use incremental computation
  - Could generate package specification
  - Create dataflow graph of process

## Solutions

- Kernel mods
  - [Example: PASS](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix06/tech/full_papers/muniswamy-reddy/muniswamy-reddy.pdf)
  - [Example: PASSv2](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix09/tech/full_papers/muniswamy-reddy/muniswamy-reddy.pdf)

  - Example: [SPADE+FUSE](https://github.com/ashish-gehani/SPADE/wiki/Limiting-filesystem-provenance-collection-on-Linux)
  - Pro: medium slow
  - Con: Only FS
- LD_PRELOAD
  - Incomplete

## Futher issues

### Handling distributed computation

- Each node does provenance tracing locally
- "Stitch" provenance graphs together after the fact
- [PASSv2](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix09/tech/full_papers/muniswamy-reddy/muniswamy-reddy.pdf) features stitching provenance across "layers"

### Manging storage

- Refer to package repositories where possible
- Long term archival storage issue
  - Backup in SWH
- Dedup across repository of executions
  - [Example: Reprozip](https://www.reprozip.org/)
- Prune provenance based on what is not overwritten
- Ideally, small enough to store for free in GitHub

### Granularity issues and provenance explosion

- Finer granularity => greater runtime and storage cost but more precise incremental computation
- Coarser granularity => lower runtme and storage cost but incremental computation can be imprecise
- [BEEP](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/03_1_0.pdf) describes problem and solution
