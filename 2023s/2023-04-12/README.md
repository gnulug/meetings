# Build Systems à la carte

[Build Systems à la Carte](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf)


- Scheduler Types
  - Topological: do a topological sort, and requires dependencies to be static. Easiest to parallelize.
  - Restarting: when a task requires some uncomputed dependency, stop it, do the dependency, and restart it. Best suited to dynamic dependencies. Parallelizing might do extra work, because threads might discover the same dependency.
  - Suspending: like restarting, but suspend task instead of stopping it (requires system support)
- Determining out-of-date keys:
  - Dirty bit: Note that file mtime acts just like a dirty bit
  - Verifying trace: hash of immediate inputs
  - Constructive trace: hash of immediate inputs and output (for supporting early cutoff)
  - Deep constructive trace: hash of transitive inputs
- Dependencies: static or dynamic
- Minimal: only rebuild what is necessary
- Cutoff: If compile(a) and compile(a-modified) are the same, and we already stored link(compile(a), ...), then link(compile(a-modified), ...) does not need to be re-comptued. For example, a and a-modified only changes the comments. This is an obvious optimization, but systems that use modification time, like Make, won't be able to do this.
- Cloud: Can dispatch jobs to the cloud; we know what jobs to run ahead of time.
