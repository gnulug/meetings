      - > `minisign`/`signify` - AFAIK the tools and their formats do not support streamed verification, thus they cannot simply be used together with age in command or library form in streaming use cases.

      Of course, the last syllogism is false. A and B could have established a secure channel a long time ago, B and C (not necessarily afterwards), C and D, A can rececive D's key with authenticity, but there was never a secure channel from A to D directly.

  - E2e messaging:
    - [Matrix](https://matrix.org), requires always-online server
      - Could be used for more than just chat
    - [XMPP + OMEMO](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html)
      - Pre-existing chat protocol
    - [Signal](https://signal.org/) / OpenWhisper protocol
    - Basically, device-local keys (aka host keys) that sign each other on a server.

- Discussion questions:
  - The [Monkeysphere project](https://web.archive.org/web/20200119092843/https://monkeysphere.info/) lets you use GPG keys for users to authenticate to SSH/Web servers AND authenticate servers (the reverse). Is this a good idea?
  - Are decentralized protocols inherently slow-moving and thus incompatible with up-to-date-ness?

    - [On Privacy versus Freedom by Matthew Hodgson of Matrix (2020)](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/)
  - Is it even possible to get perfect forward secrecy for a static thing, without servers?
  - In [IndieWebAuth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth), you can authenticate to arbitary web services by proving you own a domain-name, no keys or passwords involved. When would this be sufficient, and when would you want something more?
    - Indeed BlueSky, while not implementing IndieWebAuth, lets you use a [verified domain name as your account name](https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial).
    - Likewise, WKD and DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) utilize DNS as a delegatable naming authority.
